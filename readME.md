## SkillSync Frontend 🌐

*Frontend for the SkillSync decentralized mentorship marketplace*

## 📌 About

**SkillSync web** is the user-facing frontend for the SkillSync platform.  
It allows mentors and mentees to connect, manage profiles, initiate mentorship agreements, and interact with the Stellar blockchain through non-custodial wallets.

This application is designed to provide a seamless Web3 experience while abstracting blockchain complexity for end users.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Mentor & mentee onboarding
- Wallet connection (Freighter / Albedo)
- Mentorship discovery & matching
- Escrow initiation on Stellar
- Transaction status tracking
- Responsive UI

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Mentors create profiles showcasing skills, experience, and pricing
2. Mentees browse and select mentors based on their needs
3. A smart contract (Stellar Soroban) locks funds in escrow
4. Mentorship sessions are conducted off-chain (video, chat, etc.)
5. Upon completion, funds are released automatically
6. Both parties leave verifiable feedback
